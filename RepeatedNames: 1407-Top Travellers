 Difference between IFNULL and COALESCE: 
 IFNULL checks a single argument. COALESCE works with N arguments. 
 COALESCE is useful when you have an unknown number of values that you want to check. 
 IFNULL is useful when you select columns and know that it can be null but you want to represent it with a different value
