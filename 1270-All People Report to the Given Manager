# Solution 1 Union*3:

SELECT employee_id
  FROM Employees
 WHERE manager_id = 1 AND employee_id != 1
 UNION
 SELECT e1.employee_id
  FROM Employees e1
  JOIN Employees e2 ON (e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id AND e2.manager_id = 1 AND e1.employee_id != 1)
 UNION
 SELECT e1.employee_id
  FROM Employees e1
  JOIN Employees e2 ON (e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id)
  JOIN Employees e3 ON (e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id AND e3.manager_id = 1 AND e1.employee_id != 1)
ORDER BY 1


# Solution 2 With Recursive:

WITH RECURSIVE tmp AS(
    SELECT employee_id, 1 n FROM Employees WHERE employee_id !=1 and manager_id =1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT a.employee_id, n+1 FROM Employees a JOIN tmp b WHERE a.manager_id = b.employee_id AND n<3
)
SELECT employee_id FROM tmp
 ORDER BY 1
