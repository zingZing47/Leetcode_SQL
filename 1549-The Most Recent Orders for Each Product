Solution:
WITH a AS(
SELECT product_id
     , max(order_date) order_date
 FROM Orders o
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT product_name
     , a.product_id
     , order_id
     , a.order_date
  FROM a
  JOIN Orders o on (a.product_id = o.product_id AND a.order_date = o.order_date)
  JOIN Products p on (a.product_id = p.product_id)
 ORDER BY 1,2,3
 

 This problem requires selecting all records for the most recent order for each product, so there may be duplicates.
 
 First, use max() to select all orders for the most recent day for each product, then join another table for more information 
 and pick out the duplicate records.
 
 It can also be solved by window(), similar to 1077. Project Employees III, just rank the order_date in descending order and filter rows.
